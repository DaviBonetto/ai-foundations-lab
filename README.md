## 📖 About

This repository serves as a comprehensive laboratory for my journey through the foundations of Artificial Intelligence. Driven by a "Back to Basics" and "First Principles" philosophy, this project documents my transition from academic theory (Stanford/MIT curriculum) to high-fidelity implementation.

Whether it's deriving the gradients for Logistic Regression or architecting a Deep Convolutional GAN, every line of code here is built with rigor, documentation, and a focus on visual performance analytics.

---

## ✅ Key Features

- ✅ **From-scratch implementations**: Neural networks and ML algorithms built using only NumPy.
- ✅ **LaTeX math explanations**: Detailed derivations for cost functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.
- ✅ **Clean documented code**: High-quality, professional code with comprehensive comments.
- ✅ **Jupyter visualizations**: Real-time plotting of training curves, decision boundaries, and model outputs.
- ✅ **Real-world projects**: Applied computer vision (YOLOv8) and generative models (GANs).
